# BME680 Sensor Driver Update (Ver 4.25.1)

## Overview
This update modifies the BME680 sensor drivers for P2 and P3 to faithfully use the Adafruit algorithm stored in G:\RPi-Development\OK2bme. This change enables more accurate measurements from the sensors.

## Changes Made

### 1. BME680 Driver Update
- Completely rewrote the BME680 driver based on Adafruit's reference implementation
- Aligned temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance calculation algorithms with the reference implementation
- Added altitude calculation functionality
- Improved heater control for better gas measurement accuracy

### 2. Key Improvements
- **Temperature Measurement**: Implemented Adafruit's algorithm for more accurate temperature compensation
- **Humidity Measurement**: Adopted the reference implementation's humidity calculation algorithm for improved accuracy
- **Pressure Measurement**: Adopted the reference implementation's pressure calculation algorithm for improved accuracy
- **Gas Resistance Measurement**: 
  - Properly enabled the heater (`ctrl_gas |= 0x10`)
  - Correctly calculated heater resistance and limited it to the 0-255 range
  - Adopted the reference implementation's gas resistance calculation algorithm

### 3. Maintained Features
- I2C address auto-detection (0x76 or 0x77)
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Improved stability for Thonny compatibility

## Technical Details

### Key Changes
1. **Heater Control Improvements**:
   ```python
   # Enable heater
   ctrl_gas = self._read_byte(BME680_REG_CTRL_GAS)
   ctrl_gas |= 0x10  # heater enable bit
   self._write(BME680_REG_CTRL_GAS, [ctrl_gas])
   
   # Calculate and limit heater resistance
   heatr_res = int(3.4 + ((temp - 20) * 0.6 / 100) * 1000)
   heatr_res = min(max(0, heatr_res), 255)  # Limit to 0-255
   ```

2. **Ambient Temperature Setting**:
   ```python
   # Set default ambient temperature
   amb_temp = 25  # Default room temperature
   ```

3. **Calibration Data Reading Method**:
   - Adopted the reference implementation's calibration data parsing method
   - Used struct unpacking to properly parse binary data

4. **Measurement Calculation Algorithms**:
   - Used Adafruit's algorithms for temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance calculations
   - Added altitude calculation functionality

## Usage
The usage of the BME680 sensor remains the same as before, but now provides more accurate measurements:

```python
from machine import I2C, Pin
from sensor_drivers.bme680 import BME680_I2C

# Initialize I2C bus
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(1), sda=Pin(0), freq=100000)

# Initialize BME680 sensor (auto-detect address)
bme = BME680_I2C(i2c)

# Get measurements
temperature = bme.temperature
humidity = bme.humidity
pressure = bme.pressure
gas = bme.gas
altitude = bme.altitude

# Or get all measurements at once
readings = bme.get_readings()
```

## Notes
- This driver is optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
- The same driver is used for both P2 and P3
- Measurement accuracy may vary depending on sensor placement and calibration
