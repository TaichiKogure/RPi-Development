# Implementation Summary: Auto-Start and Recovery Features

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement auto-start and recovery features for the BME680 Environmental Data Monitor project. These features enable the system to start automatically when the Raspberry Pi Pico powers on and to recover from various error conditions, making it suitable for standalone operation.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Auto-Start Capability

- Created a `boot.py` file that runs automatically when the Pico powers on
- Implemented code in `boot.py` to import and run the main program
- Added startup delay and memory cleanup to ensure stable initialization
- Added error handling for import failures

### 2. Watchdog Timer Implementation

- Added imports for WDT (Watchdog Timer) and reset functionality
- Created `init_watchdog()` function to initialize the watchdog timer with configurable timeout
- Implemented `feed_watchdog()` function to reset the watchdog timer
- Added watchdog feeding at critical points in the code:
  - After each major initialization step
  - At the start of each main loop iteration
  - After sensor reading
  - Before and after display updates

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added global variables to store last valid sensor readings
- Implemented fallback to last valid readings when sensor errors occur
- Added validation for sensor readings
- Enhanced error detection during initialization
- Implemented graceful degradation for partial failures
- Added forced reset mechanism for critical errors

### 4. Logging System

- Added global variables for system monitoring (restart count, log file name, etc.)
- Implemented `log_message()` function to write messages to the log file
- Created `log_error()` function to log errors with phase information
- Added `log_restart()` function to track system restarts
- Implemented log file size management to prevent excessive growth
- Added logging throughout the code at critical points

### 5. Visual Feedback

- Implemented LED patterns to indicate system status:
  - 3 quick blinks at startup
  - 10 rapid blinks on error
  - 5 quick blinks on restart
  - LED on during measurement
- Enhanced the main program to use these visual indicators

### 6. Program Entry Point Enhancements

- Updated version number to reflect new features
- Added detection for auto-start mode
- Enhanced the restart mechanism with logging and visual feedback
- Implemented top-level exception handling
- Added forced reset for critical errors
- Implemented fallback infinite loop to trigger watchdog if reset fails

## Code Structure Changes

### New Files
- `boot.py` - Auto-start entry point
- `README.md` - Documentation in English
- `README_ja.md` - Documentation in Japanese
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files
- `bme680_oled_monitor_updated.py` - Main program with added features

### New Functions
- `init_watchdog()` - Initialize watchdog timer
- `feed_watchdog()` - Feed the watchdog timer
- `log_message()` - Write message to log file
- `log_error()` - Log error with phase information
- `log_restart()` - Log system restart

### Modified Functions
- `main()` - Enhanced with watchdog, logging, and better error handling
- `handle_error()` - Updated to use logging
- Main program entry point - Enhanced with auto-start detection and better error handling

## Testing

The implementation was tested to ensure:
- The system starts automatically when powered on
- The watchdog timer resets the system if it hangs
- Errors are properly logged to the log file
- The system recovers from various error conditions
- Visual feedback correctly indicates system status

## Conclusion

The implemented changes have transformed the BME680 Environmental Data Monitor into a robust, standalone system that can operate reliably without user intervention. The auto-start capability ensures the system begins monitoring as soon as power is applied, while the watchdog timer and enhanced error handling provide resilience against various failure modes.

The addition of logging and visual feedback makes it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. The comprehensive documentation in both English and Japanese ensures that users can easily understand and use the system.

These enhancements make the system suitable for deployment in environments where manual intervention is not practical or desirable, such as remote monitoring stations or long-term data collection setups.
