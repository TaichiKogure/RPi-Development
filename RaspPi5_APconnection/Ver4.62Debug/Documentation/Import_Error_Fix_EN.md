# Module Import Error Fix

## Problem Overview

The following errors were occurring in the Raspberry Pi 5 Environmental Monitor System (Ver4.62Debug):

```
Failed to import refactored modules from p1_software_solo405 package: No module named 'p1_software_solo405'
Failed to import refactored modules from relative path: No module named 'p1_software_solo405'
Cannot continue without required modules
Error in WiFi monitor: 'WiFiMonitor' object has no attribute 'run'
```

These errors prevented the data collection service, web interface, and connection monitor from starting properly, causing them to repeatedly restart.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Package Structure Fix

The root cause of the problem was that the `p1_software_solo405` directory was not being recognized as a Python package. In Python, a directory needs an `__init__.py` file to be treated as a package.

As a fix, the following file was created:
- `G:\RPi-Development\RaspPi5_APconnection\Ver4.62Debug\p1_software_solo405\__init__.py`

This file allows the `p1_software_solo405` directory to be correctly recognized as a Python package, resolving the module import errors.

### 2. Method Call Fix

The WiFi monitor error (`'WiFiMonitor' object has no attribute 'run'`) was caused by calling the `monitor.run()` method in the `P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py` file, but the `WiFiMonitor` class actually implements a `start()` method, not a `run()` method.

As a fix, the following file was modified:
- `G:\RPi-Development\RaspPi5_APconnection\Ver4.62Debug\p1_software_solo405\connection_monitor\P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py`

The call to `monitor.run()` was changed to `monitor.start()`, resolving this error.

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. When changing the package structure, always make sure to create `__init__.py` files in each directory that should be treated as a package.
2. When calling methods on a class, verify that the class actually implements those methods.
3. When encountering module import errors, first check the package structure and import paths.

These fixes have restored the normal operation of the Raspberry Pi 5 Environmental Monitor System (Ver4.62Debug).
