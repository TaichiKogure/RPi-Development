# Ver2.1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes implemented for Ver2.1 of the Raspberry Pi 5 and Pico 2W Standalone Environmental Data Measurement System. The implementation focused on two main requirements:

1. Adding terminal reporting for P2-P6 signal strength and ping at 80-second intervals
2. Updating P1_ap_setup_solo.py for Ver2.0 compatibility

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Terminal Reporting for P2-P6 Signal Strength and Ping

#### Modified Files:
- `p1_software_solo405/connection_monitor/config.py`
- `p1_software_solo405/connection_monitor/monitor.py`

#### New Files:
- `p1_software_solo405/connection_monitor/terminal_reporter.py`

#### Changes:
- Updated the DEFAULT_CONFIG in config.py to:
  - Include P2 and P3 devices (previously only had P4, P5, P6)
  - Set the monitor interval to 80 seconds (previously 5 seconds)
- Updated monitor.py to initialize connection_data for all devices (P2-P6)
- Created a new script (terminal_reporter.py) that:
  - Runs the WiFi connection monitor in console mode
  - Displays the connection status of P2-P6 devices in the terminal
  - Updates at 80-second intervals
  - Includes version information (2.1.0)

### 2. P1_ap_setup_solo.py Ver2.0 Compatibility

#### Modified Files:
- `p1_software_solo405/ap_setup/P1_ap_setup_solo.py`

#### New Files:
- `p1_software_solo405/ap_setup/P1_ap_setup_solo_changes_JP.md`
- `p1_software_solo405/ap_setup/P1_ap_setup_solo_changes_EN.md`

#### Changes:
- Updated the version number from "4.0.0-solo" to "2.1.0"
- Removed references to MH-Z19C sensors, keeping only BME680 sensors
- Updated the device list from "P2 and P3" to "P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6"
- Updated the parser description in the main function
- Updated the dnsmasq configuration comment
- Created documentation in both Japanese and English explaining the changes

## Usage Instructions

### Terminal Reporting
To run the terminal reporting for P2-P6 signal strength and ping:

```bash
cd /path/to/p1_software_solo405/connection_monitor
python3 terminal_reporter.py
```

This will display the connection status of P2-P6 devices in the terminal, updating every 80 seconds. Press Ctrl+C to exit.

### Access Point Setup
To configure the Raspberry Pi as an access point:

```bash
sudo python3 /path/to/p1_software_solo405/ap_setup/P1_ap_setup_solo.py --configure
```

Other available commands:
- `--enable`: Enable the access point
- `--disable`: Disable the access point
- `--status`: Check the status of the access point

## Verification
The implementation has been verified to meet all the requirements specified in the issue description:

1. Terminal reporting for P2-P6 signal strength and ping at 80-second intervals ✓
2. P1_ap_setup_solo.py updated for Ver2.0 compatibility ✓
3. Documentation created in both Japanese and English ✓

## Notes
- The Ver2.0 system only supports BME680 sensors and does not support CO2 sensors (MH-Z19C)
- The access point is configured with the following parameters:
  - SSID: RaspberryPi5_AP_Solo2
  - Password: raspberry
  - IP Address: 192.168.0.2
  - DHCP Range: 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.150
