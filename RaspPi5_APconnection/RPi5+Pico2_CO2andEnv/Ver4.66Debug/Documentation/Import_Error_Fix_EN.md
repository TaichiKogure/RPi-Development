# Import Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The project was experiencing an import error when running the `P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py` script directly:

```
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

This error occurred because the script was using relative imports (e.g., `from .config import DEFAULT_CONFIG`) but was being executed as a standalone script rather than as part of a package.

## Root Cause

In Python, relative imports (those that start with a dot `.`) can only be used when the module is part of a package and is being imported, not when the module is being executed directly.

When a Python file is executed directly (e.g., `python filename.py`), it is treated as the "main" module and has no parent package, so relative imports cannot be resolved.

The specific problematic imports in `P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py` were:

```python
from .config import DEFAULT_CONFIG, ensure_log_directory
from .monitor import WiFiMonitor
from .utils.console import print_connection_status
from .main import main as refactored_main
```

## Solution

The solution involved two key changes:

1. **Changed relative imports to absolute imports**:
   ```python
   from connection_monitor.config import DEFAULT_CONFIG, ensure_log_directory
   from connection_monitor.monitor import WiFiMonitor
   from connection_monitor.utils.console import print_connection_status
   from connection_monitor.main import main as refactored_main
   ```

2. **Added code to ensure the parent directory is in the Python path**:
   ```python
   # Add the parent directory to the Python path so we can import from connection_monitor
   parent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
   if parent_dir not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)
   ```

This ensures that when `P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py` is executed directly, Python can find the `connection_monitor` package.

## Best Practices for Python Imports

To avoid similar issues in the future, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use absolute imports when possible**: Absolute imports are more explicit and less prone to errors when the project structure changes.

2. **Organize your code as proper Python packages**: Ensure each directory that contains Python modules has an `__init__.py` file.

3. **Consider using a proper Python package structure**: If your project is meant to be installed or used as a library, consider using a setup.py file and installing it in development mode.

4. **When executing scripts directly, ensure the Python path is set correctly**: You can do this by adding the parent directory to `sys.path` as shown in the solution, or by using the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

5. **Use the `-m` flag when executing modules within packages**: For example, `python -m package.module` instead of `python package/module.py`.

## Testing the Fix

To verify that the fix works:

1. Run the `P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py` script directly:
   ```
   python p1_software_solo405/connection_monitor/P1_wifi_monitor_solo.py
   ```

2. Check that no import errors occur and the script runs as expected.

3. Verify that the script still works when called from `start_p1_solo.py`.
