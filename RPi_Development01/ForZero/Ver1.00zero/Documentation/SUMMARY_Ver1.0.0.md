# Environmental Data Measurement System - Version 1.0.0 Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made in Version 1.0.0 of the Environmental Data Measurement System, focusing on the expansion from P2 and P3 to include P4, P5, and P6 sensor nodes.

## Key Changes

### Software Components
1. **P4, P5, and P6 Software**
   - Created dedicated software directories for P4, P5, and P6 based on the P2 and P3 templates
   - Updated device identification in main.py files (DEVICE_ID = "P4", "P5", "P6")
   - Created device-specific WiFi client implementations (P4_wifi_client_debug.py, P5_wifi_client_debug.py, P6_wifi_client_debug.py)
   - Implemented error handling and watchdog functionality for all new devices

2. **P1 Software Updates**
   - Updated configuration to recognize and collect data from P4, P5, and P6
   - Added data directories for P4, P5, and P6 (RawData_P4, RawData_P5, RawData_P6)
   - Modified data collection logic to handle data from all sensor nodes
   - Updated WiFi monitoring to track connection quality with all devices

### Documentation Updates
1. **Installation Guide**
   - Updated English and Japanese versions to include P4, P5, and P6 setup instructions
   - Added sections for uploading software to new devices
