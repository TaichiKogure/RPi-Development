# Final Review Summary - BME680 Only Mode (Version 2.0)

## Implementation Status

All requirements for the BME680 Only Mode (Version 2.0) have been successfully implemented:

1. **P1 Data Collection Modifications**:
   - Modified CSV file headers to remove CO2 data column while maintaining compatibility
   - Updated data storage functions to handle BME680 data only
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code structure

2. **P2-P6 Sensor Node Modifications**:
   - Disabled CO2 sensor (MH-Z19C) initialization in all sensor node code
   - Removed CO2 sensor registration in data transmitters
   - Updated data collection and transmission to work with BME680 only
   - Maintained code structure for future extensibility

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive operation manuals in both English and Japanese
   - Created detailed installation guides in both English and Japanese
   - Included hardware setup, software installation, system verification, and troubleshooting information

## Verification Results

- **Code Review**: All references to CO2 sensors in the Ver2.00zeroOne directory have been properly disabled or commented out
- **Compatibility Check**: CSV file format maintains backward compatibility with existing tools
- **Documentation Review**: All documentation accurately reflects the BME680-only mode

## Conclusion

The implementation of BME680 Only Mode (Version 2.0) is complete and ready for deployment. The system will work properly with BME680 sensors only, collecting and visualizing temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance data.

For future enhancements, the code structure has been maintained to allow for easy reintegration of CO2 sensor functionality if needed.
