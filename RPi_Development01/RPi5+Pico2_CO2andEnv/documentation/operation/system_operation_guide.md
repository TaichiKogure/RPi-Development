## System Overview
The environmental data measurement system consists of:
- **P1 (Raspberry Pi 5)**: Central hub that acts as a WiFi access point, collects data, and provides a web interface
- **P2 and P3 (Raspberry Pi Pico 2W)**: Sensor nodes that collect environmental data and transmit it to P1
- **Sensors**: BME680 (temperature, humidity, pressure, gas) and MH-Z19B (CO2)

The system operates as follows:
1. P2 and P3 collect environmental data every 30 seconds
2. The data is transmitted to P1 via WiFi
3. P1 stores the data and makes it available through a web interface
4. Users can view real-time and historical data, and export it for analysis
