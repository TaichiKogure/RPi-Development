# BME680 OLED Display Layout Changes

## Summary of Changes

The display layout in `bme680_oled_monitorX.py` has been modified to improve readability and simplify the presentation of environmental data. The following changes were made:

1. **Changed from column-based to row-based layout**
   - Each data point now has its own dedicated row
   - All data is aligned to the left side of the display
   - Improved spacing for better readability

2. **Simplified date/time format**
   - Date is now displayed as numbers only (YYYYMMDD)
   - Time is now displayed as numbers only (HHMMSS)
   - Removed formatting characters like hyphens and colons

3. **Removed labels from sensor data**
   - Removed text labels like "Temp:", "RH:", etc.
   - Only showing values with their units
   - Example: "25.3C" instead of "Temp: 25.3C"

4. **Updated documentation**
   - Updated file header to reflect the new display format
   - Incremented version number to 1.2

## Testing Recommendations

To test the modified code on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W:

1. Transfer the updated `bme680_oled_monitorX.py` file to the Pico 2W
2. Ensure the BME680 sensor and SSD1306 OLED display are properly connected
3. Run the program and verify:
   - All data points are displayed in a row-based layout
   - Date and time are shown as numbers only
   - Sensor values are displayed without labels, only with units
   - All information is clearly readable on the display

## Expected Display Layout

```
20250727       (Date - Row 1)
225530         (Time - Row 2)
25.3C          (Temperature - Row 3)
45.2%          (Relative Humidity - Row 4)
10.5g/m3       (Absolute Humidity - Row 5)
1013hPa        (Pressure - Row 6)
12.5kohm       (Gas Resistance - Row 7)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check all hardware connections
- Verify that the BME680 sensor is properly initialized
- Ensure the SSD1306 display is working correctly
- Check the console output for any error messages

The program includes error handling that will attempt to restart if any issues are detected.
